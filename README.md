# brainspin v1

brainstorms are hard. wtf do i sayy ? do i just stare at the wall ? yes to both.

### UNTIL NOW

i created brainspin ( on my own time, lawyers. on my own time 🙂 ) for use in brainstorms at M---F.

basically i just went through my twitter likes and pulled crunchy and tasty pics and threw them in a folder.

then i made this kind of slot machine pairing interface. super simple.

it also has some words amongst the imgs. i stole oblique strategies ( thanks brian ). and also threw some additional inspiring words like porno and good smell.

and hey ! people liked it. i don't think it led to any projects. but it led to gooooood times. and isn't that why we're here after all ?
