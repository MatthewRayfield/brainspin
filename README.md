# brainspin

brainstorms are hard. wtf do i sayy ? do i just stare at the wall ? yes to both.

### UNTIL NOW

i created brainspin ( on my own time, lawyers. on my own time 🙂 ) for use in brainstorms at M***F ( formerly known as MSCHF ).

basically i just went through my twitter likes and pulled crunchy and tasty pics and threw them in a folder.

then made i this kind of slot machine pairing interface. super simple.

it also has some words amongst the imgs. i stole oblique strategies ( thanks brian ). and also threw some additional inspiring words like porno and good smell.

and hey ! people liked it. i don't think it led to any projects. but it led to gooooood times. and isn't that why we're here after all ?

## FAQ (lol)

- wut about citing your sources ?!?
    - yes fair. but seee i never intended this to leave my junk server. hence why it took me 3 years to put it in git. but here we are. BUT these truly were mostly grabbed from my twitter likes. ~~so you can find those herrre https://twitter.com/matthewrayfield/likes~~ okay big oof. twatter sux ass now. apparently it's not possible to make your likes public : [ . idk what's going on over there. buuuut these images are pretty findable with reverse image search 🫡 like the internet indended
